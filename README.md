# ML_Artists_Classifier

The ML_Artists_Classifier is a machine learning project that uses logistic regression to predict the following artists:

- 0: Chris Evans
- 1: Daniel Padilla
- 2: Enrique Gil
- 3: Kathryn Bernardo
- 4: Manny Pacquiao
- 5: Taylor Swift

## Description

The goal of this project is to classify images of various artists into one of the six categories listed above. Logistic Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for binary and multi-class classification tasks, is utilized for this purpose. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of the artists, and once trained, it can predict the artist from new unseen images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of images of the six artists mentioned above. The images are organized in separate directories, each directory representing one artist. The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The dataset is obtained using fatkun chrome extension.
